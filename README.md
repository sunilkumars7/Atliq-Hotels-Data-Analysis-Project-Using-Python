# Atliq Grands Hospitality Data Analysis

## Problem Statement:

Atliq Grands, a hotel chain with over 20 years in the hospitality industry, has seen a decline in market share and revenue due to strategic moves by competitors. The management has expressed concern about the situation and has hired a team of data analysts to explore potential solutions.

## Project Objective:

The primary objective of this project is to analyze Atliq Grands' hospitality data to uncover insights that can help the company regain its market share and increase its revenue.

## Dataset Overview:

The dataset comprises 5 CSV files:

1. **dim_date.csv** – Contains information about dates, weeks, and day types.
2. **dim_hotels.csv** – Contains details of hotel properties, categories, and cities.
3. **dim_rooms.csv** – Provides details on room categories.
4. **fact_aggregated_bookings.csv** – Contains aggregated booking information across hotels.
5. **fact_bookings.csv** – Contains detailed booking records, including booking IDs, check-in/check-out dates, revenue, and booking platform.

## Project Workflow

### 1. **Understanding the Business Problem**

Before working on the project, it is crucial to have a clear understanding of the business problem and the project’s objectives.

### 2. **Data Collection**

The necessary data fields, related to the business problem, are collected for analysis.

### 3. **Data Understanding and Exploration**

To get a basic understanding of the dataset, we perform the following operations using tools like **NumPy** and **Pandas** for data manipulation, and **Matplotlib** and **Seaborn** for data visualization:
- Retrieve the top 5 records to examine columns and values.
- Determine the number of rows and columns in the dataset.
- Check for duplicate records.
- Check for missing (null) values.
- Check the data types of each column.
- Generate descriptive statistics for the dataset.

### 4. **Data Cleaning**

This step involves identifying and resolving errors, inconsistencies, missing values, and duplicates:
- In the `fact_aggregated_bookings.csv` file, the 'successful bookings' column contains outliers which are treated.
- In the `fact_bookings.csv` file, the 'no guests' and 'revenue generated' columns contain outliers that are addressed.

### 5. **Data Transformation**

Data transformation operations are performed to clean, format, and structure the data for easier analysis:
- A key metric, **occupancy percentage (occ_pct)**, is calculated in the `fact_aggregated_bookings.csv` file.
- Date fields in all relevant CSV files are converted from object type to datetime format for easier analysis.

Using **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** techniques, the following insights were generated:

#### **Booking Performance in Different Cities**
